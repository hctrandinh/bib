Notice: I generated the localisation (longitude/latitude) of all my scrapping results with BingMap.js script and copy/pasted the raw data inside my distance.js file as I had some issues with manipulating it from another file in coordination with react. So only your localisation is fetched from microsoft map api each time you make a request and also the distance between your city and all raw coordinates. Results are then compared and the page displays the best result.
